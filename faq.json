                "Overfitting happens when a model learns the detail and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data. This means that the noise or random fluctuations in the training data is picked up and learned as concepts by the model. The problem is that these concepts do not apply to new data and negatively impact the models ability to generalize.  Overfitting is more likely with nonparametric and nonlinear models that have more flexibility when learning a target function. As such, many nonparametric machine learning algorithms also include parameters or techniques to limit and constrain how much detail the model learns."

Training Data<br>NLP is mainly about studying the language and to be proficient, it is essential to spend a substantial amount of time listening, reading, and understanding it. NLP systems focus on skewed and inaccurate data to learn inefficiently and incorrectly.<br>2. Development Time<br>The total time taken to develop an NLP system is higher. AI evaluates the data points to process them and use them accordingly. The GPUs and deep network work on training the datasets that can be reduced by a few hours. The pre-existing NLP technologies can help in developing the product from scratch.<br>3. Homonyms<br>Another major challenge about NLP is Homonyms that mean words with multiple meanings. Humans can interpret the meaning behind the words that have multiple meanings according to the situation but for machines, it can be difficult to identify.<br>4. Misspellings<br>It is not uncommon for humans to make spelling mistakes that can be difficult to interpret. The machine needs to detect the work properly and hence it is essential to employ NLP technology to progress and identify the misspellings.<br>5. False Positives<br>NLP can detect addressable and intelligible worlds but false positives or uncertainty is something that can be difficult for them. The developers need to create an NLP system to clear up and identify the uncertainty."

Originally, it addressed two-person zero-sum games, in which each participant's gains or losses are exactly balanced by those of other participants. In the 21st century, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations; it is now an umbrella term for the science of logical decision making in humans, animals, as well as computers. Modern game theory began with the idea of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person zero-sum game and its proof by John von Neumann. Von Neumann's original proof used the Brouwer fixed-point theorem on continuous mappings into compact convex sets, which became a standard method in game theory and mathematical economics."

Thus, every car can be safely driven on such a banked curve at certain optimum speed, without depending on friction. Hence , a road should be properly banked at a bend.

                "Hedgerow intercropping, also known as alley cropping, consists of growing one/two rows of perennials trees or shrubs (preferably leguminous) at a close spacing in the form of hedges. These hedges are spaced 4\u00e2\u20ac\u201c8 m, and crops are grown simultaneously in between the hedgerows. The hedge serves as a barrier for checking movement of soil and water along the slope and contributes to soil conservation. Once grown, hedges are pruned regularly and added to soil surface as mulch, which helps in checking soil erosion, reducing evaporation, enhancing weed suppression, and adding nutrients in the soils. The improved soil quality and health, and better nutrient cycling under the hedgerow intercropping system contribute to improvement in the crop growth and productivity. Continuously soil deposition near hedges leads to the formation of biological terrace-like structure in long term. Leucaena leucocephala, G. sepium, Cassia siamea are the most recommended species for hedgerow cropping systems in humid to semi-humid climate due to their capacity to rapidly produce the dense hedge and high biomass. However, many indigenous species have also demonstrated strong potential to act as hedgerows."

                "1. Small and fragmented land-holdings:<br>   The seemingly abundance of net sown area of 141.2 million hectares and total cropped area of 189.7 million hectares (1999-2000) pales into insignificance when we see that it is divided into economically unviable small and scattered holdings.<br>The average size of holdings was 2.28 hectares in 1970-71 which was reduced to 1.82 hectares in 1980-81 and 1.50 hectares in 1995-96. The size of the holdings will further decrease with the infinite Sub-division of the land holdings.<br>2. Seeds:<br>   Seed is a critical and basic input for attaining higher crop yields and sustained growth in agricultural production. Distribution of assured quality seed is as critical as the production of such seeds. Unfortunately, good quality seeds are out of reach of the majority of farmers, especially small and marginal farmers mainly because of exorbitant prices of better seeds.<br>3. Manures, Fertilizers and Biocides:<br>   Indian soils have been used for growing crops over thousands of years without caring much for replenishing. This has led to depletion and exhaustion of soils resulting in their low productivity. The average yields of almost all the crops are among the lowest in the world. This is a serious problem which can be solved by using more manures and fertilizers.<br>5. Irrigation:<br>   Although India is the second largest irrigated country of the world after China, only one-third of the cropped area is under irrigation. Irrigation is the most important agricultural input in a tropical monsoon country like India where rainfall is uncertain, unreliable and erratic India cannot achieve sustained progress in agriculture unless and until more than half of the cropped area is brought under assured irrigation.<br>6. Lack of mechanisation:<br>   In spite of the large scale mechanisation of agriculture in some parts of the country, most of the agricultural operations in larger parts are carried on by human hand using simple and conventional tools and implements like wooden plough, sickle, etc.<br>7. Soil erosion:<br>   Large tracts of fertile land suffer from soil erosion by wind and water. This area must be properly treated and restored to its original fertility.<br>8. Agricultural Marketing:<br>   Agricultural marketing still continues to be in a bad shape in rural India. In the absence of sound marketing facilities, the farmers have to depend upon local traders and middlemen for the disposal of their farm produce which is sold at throw-away price.<br>9. Scarcity of capital: <br>   Agriculture is an important industry and like all other industries it also requires capital. The role of capital input is becoming more and more important with the advancement of farm technology. Since the agriculturists' capital is locked up in his lands and stocks, he is obliged to borrow money for stimulating the tempo of agricultural production."

                "Digital agriculture, sometimes known as smart farming or e-agriculture, is tools that digitally collect, store, analyze, and share electronic data and/or information in agriculture. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has described the digitalization process of agriculture as the digital agricultural revolution. Other definitions, such as those from the United Nations Project Breakthrough,Cornell University, and Purdue University, also emphasize the role of digital technology in the optimization of food systems. Digital agriculture includes (but is not limited to) precision agriculture. Unlike precision agriculture, digital agriculture impacts the entire agri-food value chain \u00e2\u20ac\u201d before, during, and after on-farm production. Therefore, on-farm technologies, like yield mapping, GPS guidance systems, and variable-rate application, fall under the domain of precision agriculture and digital agriculture. On the other hand, digital technologies involved in e-commerce platforms, e-extension services, warehouse receipt systems, blockchain-enabled food traceability systems, tractor rental apps, etc. fall under the umbrella of digital agriculture but not precision agriculture."

                "One of the primary reasons to safely eject the USB drive is to avoid corrupting data contained within it. When you insert the USB into a port, there is potentially loads of data being written onto that drive. Ejecting the USB drive even before the process is completed can result in the data being compromised. However, even if the USB is not in active use, there is still a danger of corrupting the files. Most operating systems use a caching process. This means that the data is not written immediately onto the USB drive. Some of this information could still be stored on your computer's RAM. When you perform a copy command, the computer (depending on the operating system) might perform a series of requests. This can lengthen the process of transferring data from the computer to the USB. This is especially true when you are handling a large amount of data or files. Therefore, you need to wait for the USB drive's command to safely eject the hardware before you do so."

If the website in question has a great deal of your personal data, and that data is unencrypted and relatively unsecured, there's a good chance that the hacker has that data as well. From there, a hacker can begin a social engineering campaign designed to gain access to more valuable user data. For instance, most web services use email addresses to validate new passwords. If hackers gain access to your email account, they can reset passwords to many different services you use and then utilize those services to obtain even more data, like your address or even financial information. This is why security experts generally recommend changing email passwords whenever user data gets exposed. Even if the data breach doesn't directly involve your email account, changing the password ensures that you don't hand over the keys to your kingdom to an enterprising cybercriminal."

Additionally, you also need a modem and cables running to and from the dish to your modem. Once everything is connected, the ISP will send the internet signal to the dish in space which relays it to you. Whenever you make a request, it goes to the dish in space and to the ISP's hub. Then the completed request is sent back through space first to your dish and then to your computer.

                "There are a few sounds such as nails on the chalkboard, that make one's skin crawl. This happens because when we hear the sound and the sound waves travel from our ears to the brain. Thus the sound energy is converted into nerve impulse. These nerve impulses travel to the auditory cortex of the temporal lobes of the brain and are processed there. Our perception for sound is increased by another structure of the brain called amygdala, and is linked with a particular emotion of fear and unpleasantness. A physical response is evoked such as goosebumps or the sensation that something is crawling on the skin."

Let's take a closer look at how this works: <br>1.When sounds come out of someone's mouth to create words, it also makes a series of vibrations. Speech to text technology works by picking up on these vibrations and translating them into a digital language through an analog to digital converter.<br>2.The analog-to-digital-converter takes sounds from an audio file, measures the waves in great detail, and filters them to distinguish the relevant sounds.<br>3.The sounds are then segmented into hundredths or thousandths of seconds and are then matched to phonemes.

For example, there are approximately 40 phonemes in the English language.<br>4.The phonemes are then run through a network via a mathematical model that compares them to well-known sentences, words, and phrases.<br>5.The text is then presented as text or a computer-based demand based on the audio's most likely version."

Biodegradable materials such as paper, cardboard, and food quickly disintegrate, degrade, and are eaten by microorganisms in the ocean. However, materials such as plastic, glass, and metal do not degrade as well. Glass and metal tend to be heavy enough that they sink to the bottom of the ocean, out of sight. On the other hand, most plastic objects float on the surface of the ocean.

            "answer": [
                "Icebergs do not have any salt to begin with. Icebergs are not pieces of frozen ocean water. Rather, icebergs are frozen chunks of fresh water that began their life on land. It all starts when snow falls in a region of land that is too cold for the snow to melt. Over time, the non-salty snow builds up on the ground. Without temperatures warm enough to melt the snow, it piles up so high that it starts to crush under its own weight. The crushing force of gravity fuses the non-salty snow crystals into a giant slab of non-salty ice known as a glacier. This process is very slow and takes a long time. Gravity not only pulls the snow down into the ice, it also pulls the ice downhill. Often 'downhill' means 'towards the ocean'. Very slowly, the giant slab of ice slides downhill to the ocean. Once it reaches the ocean, it just keeps going like a train with no brakes. A glacier is so big that just the very edge of it slides out over the ocean. Because ice floats on water, the edge of a glacier has no problem just sitting there, floating on the ocean.But eventually, the glacier slides too far out over the ocean, stretches from the movement, and cracks on the edges. Warm temperatures can also speed up the cracking process. Once the crack is deep enough, pieces of the glacier break away and drift out into the open ocean. A new iceberg is born. Note that this explanation may make it sound like a one time event. In reality, each glacier is continually forming, flowing, and cracking. One end of a glacier up in the mountains is forming from the new snow, while at the same time, the other end is cracking over the ocean and making icebergs. Because the glacier is very deep, the iceberg chunks that break off are very tall. The word 'iceberg' literally means 'ice mountain' in Germanic languages, signifying their height. In contrast, frozen ocean water forms thin flat sheets called pack ice. In summary, non-salty snow turns into non-salty glacier ice on land, which breaks into non-salty icebergs over the ocean."

                "Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks. A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers; but not all machine learning is statistical learning. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.Some implementations of machine learning use data and neural networks in a way that mimics the working of a biological brain. In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics."

Big data was originally associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity.[3] The analysis of big data presents challenges in sampling, and thus previously allowing for only observations and sampling. Therefore, big data often includes data with sizes that exceed the capacity of traditional software to process within an acceptable time and value."

A logistic regression model predicts a dependent data variable by analyzing the relationship between one or more existing independent variables. For example, a logistic regression could be used to predict whether a political candidate will win or lose an election or whether a high school student will be admitted or not to a particular college. These binary outcomes allow straightforward decisions between two alternatives. A logistic regression model can take into consideration multiple input criteria. In the case of college acceptance, the logistic function could consider factors such as the student's grade point average, SAT score and number of extracurricular activities. Based on historical data about earlier outcomes involving the same input criteria, it then scores new cases on their probability of falling into one of two outcome categories."

For instance, a proficient archer's arrows are expected to land around the bull's eye of the target; however, due to aggregating imperfections in the archer's technique, most arrows will miss the bull's eye by some distance. The average of this distance is known in archery as accuracy, while the amount of variation in the distances as precision. In the context of a normal distribution, accuracy and precision are referred to as the mean and the standard deviation, respectively. Thus, a narrow measure of an archer's proficiency can be expressed with two values: a mean and a standard deviation. In a normal distribution, these two values mean: there is a ~68% probability that an arrow will land within one standard deviation of the archer's average accuracy; a ~95% probability that an arrow will land within two standard deviations of the archer's average accuracy; ~99.7% within three; and so on, slowly increasing towards 100%."

            ],
            "answer": [
                "The concern that online students cheat more than traditional students is perhaps misplaced. When researchers at Marshall University conducted a study to measure the prevalence of cheating in online and classroom-based courses, they concluded, \"somewhat surprisingly, the results showed higher rates of academic dishonesty in live courses.\" The authors suggest the social familiarity of students in a classroom setting may lessen their sense of moral obligation.Another reason cheating is less common in online programs is that colleges have adopted strict anti-cheating protocols and technologies. According to a report published by the Online Learning Consortium, some online courses require students to report to proctored testing facilities to complete exams, though virtual proctoring using shared screens and webcams is increasingly popular. Sophisticated identity verification tools like biometric analysis and facial recognition software are another way these schools combat cheating. Instructors often implement their own anti-cheating measures, too, like running research papers through plagiarism-detection programs or incorporating challenge-based questions in quizzes and exams. When combined, these measures can reduce academic dishonesty significantly.In an interview with OnlineEducation.com, Dr. Susan Aldridge, president of Drexel University Online, discussed the overall approach many universities take to curbing cheating-an approach that includes both technical and policy-based prevention strategies.\"Like most online higher education providers, Drexel University employs a three-pronged approach to maintaining academic integrity among its virtual students,\" said Dr. Aldridge. \"We create solid barriers to cheating, while also making every effort to identify and sanction it as it occurs or directly after the fact. At the same time, we foster a principled community of inquiry that, in turn, motivates students to act in ethical ways. So with this triad in mind, we have implemented more than a few strategies and systems to ensure academic integrity.\""

A number of colleges and universities have developed assessments to help prospective students determine whether they are prepared for online learning.

In order for an online college to be accredited, a third-party organization must review its practices, finances, instructors, and other important criteria and certify that they meet certain quality standards. The certifying organization matters, too, since accreditation is only as reliable as the agency that grants it.

Instead of going to a campus library, online students may log in to virtual libraries stocked with digital materials, or work with research librarians by phone or email. Tutoring, academic advising, and career services might rely on video conferencing software, virtual meeting rooms, and other collaborative technologies. Some online colleges offer non-academic student support services as well. For example, Western Governor University's Student Assistance Program provides online students with 24/7 access to personal counseling, legal advice, and financial consulting services. A list of student support services is usually readily available on online colleges' websites."

However, students still need basic computer skills to access and navigate these programs.

Most online programs publish such requirements on their websites. If not, an admissions adviser can help.Students who do not meet a program's basic technical skills requirements are not without recourse. Online colleges frequently offer classes and simulations that help students establish computer literacy before beginning their studies.

NLP allows AI algorithms to better understand the context and meaning of users' requests. By relying on NLP, chatbots can interpret the basic information from the conversation, correctly understand and render synonyms, jargon and common abbreviations and format the information they have collected in natural language.2.Deep Learning (DL): Through Deep Learning, our chatbots are now programmed to learn by example and determine whether their output is accurate or not on their own, helping to operationalize available data with higher accuracy and draw better conclusions3.Machine Learning (ML): This technology allows our chatbots to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed. This enables developers to train algorithms to capture data from conversations, operationalize it and turn it into some action."

The answer is simple! They are forwarded to human operators. This is why chatbot are not meant to replace humans but rather assist them. No matter how complex bots become, humans will always be better at understanding emotions. Despite the popularity that chatbots have, bots are not able to replicate a human conversation in a fully natural way yet.Indeed, it has been proven that the architecture of chatbots is limited. Traditionally, AI has struggled to meet the expectations of customers and businesses alike. When this new technology emerged, many people overestimated how smart AI would be. This has caused the chatbot hype to fall short when customers were faced with confused chatbot error messages instead of \"intelligent conversations\".Generally, chatbots struggle to understand the true intentions of the customer since they answer based on patterns and keywords on their database, making humans a much better choice for customers' inquiries. So if this new technology fails to understand simple customer inquiries, how can it possibly strive to create an emotional connection."

Conditions can be created to assess the words, the order of the words, synonyms, and more. If the incoming query matches the conditions defined by your chatbot, your customers can receive the appropriate help in no time. However, it's your job to ensure that each permutation and combination of each question is defined, otherwise, the chatbot will not understand your customer's input.

These types of chatbots utilize Machine Learning(ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to remember conversations with specific users to learn and grow over time. Unlike keyword recognition-based bots, chatbots that have contextual awareness are smart enough to self-improve based on what users are asking for and how they are asking it.For example, a contextual chatbot that allows users to order food; the chatbot will store the data from each conversation and learn what the user likes to order. The result is that eventually when a user chats with this chatbot, it will remember their most common order, their delivery address, and their payment information and merely ask if they'd like to repeat this order. Instead of having to respond to several questions the user just has to answer with 'Yes' and the food is ready! While this food ordering example is elementary, it is easy to see just how powerful conversation context can be when harnessed with AI and ML. The ultimate goal of any chatbot should be to provide an improved user experience over the alternative of the status quo. Leveraging conversation context is one of the best ways to shorten processes like these via a chatbot."

Instead, the wounds are invisible to others, hidden in the self-doubt, worthlessness, and self-loathing the victim feels. In fact, research indicates that the consequences of emotional abuse are just as severe as those from physical abuse. Over time, the accusations, verbal abuse, name-calling, criticisms, and gaslighting erode a victim's sense of self so much that they can no longer see themselves realistically. Consequently, the victim may begin to agree with the abuser and become internally critical. Once this happens, most victims become trapped in the abusive relationship believing that they will never be good enough for anyone else. Eventually, victims will pull back from friendships and isolate themselves, convinced that no one likes them. What's more, emotional abuse can cause a number of health problems including everything from depression and anxiety to stomach ulcers, heart palpitations, eating disorders, and insomnia."

            "answer": [
                "The first step in dealing with an emotionally abusive relationship is to recognize the abuse. If you were able to identify any aspect of emotional abuse in your relationship, it is important to acknowledge that first and foremost. By being honest about what you are experiencing, you can begin to take control of your life again. Here are seven more strategies for reclaiming your life that you can put into practice today.<br><br>Make Yourself a Priority: <br>When it comes to your mental and physical health, you need to make yourself a priority. Stop worrying about pleasing the person abusing you. Take care of your needs. Do something that will help you think positively and affirm who you are. Also, be sure to get an appropriate amount of rest and eat healthy meals. These simple self-care steps can go a long way in helping you deal with the day-to-day stresses of emotional abuse.<br><br>Establish Boundaries:<br>Firmly tell the abusive person that they may no longer yell at you, call you names, insult you, be rude to you, and so on. Then, tell them what will happen if they choose to engage in this behavior. For instance, tell them that if they call you names or insult you, the conversation will be over and you will leave the room. The key is to follow through on your boundaries.<br><br>Stop Blaming Yourself:<br>If you have been in an emotionally abusive relationship for any amount of time, you may believe that there is something severely wrong with you. But you are not the problem. To abuse is to make a choice. So stop blaming yourself for something you have no control over.<br><br>Realize You Can't Fix Them:<br>Despite your best efforts, you will never be able to change an emotionally abusive person by doing something different or by being different. An abusive person makes a choice to behave abusively.<br><br>Avoid Engaging:<br>Do not engage with an abusive person. In other words, if an abuser tries to start an argument with you, begins insulting you, demands things from you or rages with jealousy, do not try to make explanations, soothe their feelings, or make apologies for things you did not do. Simply walk away from the situation if you can. Engaging with an abuser only sets you up for more abuse and heartache. No matter how hard you try, you will not be able to make things right in their eyes.<br><br>Build a Support Network:<br>Although it can be tough to tell someone what you are going through, speaking up can help. Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or even a counselor about what you are experiencing. Take time away from the abusive person as much as possible and spend time with people who love and support you. This network of healthy friends and confidantes will help you feel less lonely and isolated. They also can speak truth into your life and help you put things into perspective.<br><br>Work on an Exit Plan:<br>If your partner, friend, or family member has no intention of changing or working on their poor choices, you will not be able to remain in the abusive relationship forever. It will eventually take a toll on you both mentally and physically. Depending on your situation, you may need to take steps to end the relationship. Each situation is different. So, discuss your thoughts and ideas with a trusted friend, family member, or counselor. Emotional abuse can have serious long-term effects, but it can also be a precursor to physical abuse and violence. Remember too, that abuse often escalates when the person being abused makes a decision to leave. So, be sure you have a safety plan in place should the abuse get worse. Healing from emotional abuse takes time. Taking care of yourself, reaching out to your supportive loved ones, and talking to a therapist can help."

Many are unaware of services for men, and there is a common misconception that domestic violence programs only serve women.<br>When we talk about domestic violence, we're not talking about men versus women or women versus men. We're talking about violence versus peace and control versus respect. Domestic violence affects us all, and all of us - women, children, and men - must be part of the solution."

The Connecticut Sexual Assault Crisis Services offers ways to help:<br><br>Believe the victim/survivor unconditionally. Accept what you hear without judgment.<br>Reinforce to the victim/survivor that it is not their fault. Sexual assault is NEVER the victim/survivor's fault. It is important not to ask \"why\" questions, such as \"Why were you in that area at that time?\" that suggest that they are to blame for the assault.<br>Understand that you cannot control how the victim/survivor feels or \"fix\" the problem. Everyone reacts differently to sexual assault and heals at his or her own pace. It is important that you not assume you know how they are feeling \u00e2\u20ac\u201d almost any reaction is possible and completely normal.<br>Be a good listener and be patient. Let the victim/survivor know you are there for them when they are ready to talk. When and if the victim/survivor does want to talk about the assault, do not push for information. Let them tell you what they are comfortable sharing in their own time.<br>Help the victim/survivor regain a sense of control over their life. During a sexual assault, power is taken away from the victim/survivor. Support decisions and choices the victim/survivor makes without passing judgment. Try not to tell the victim/survivor what to do; instead assist by presenting options and resources for them to make the decision that is right for them.<br>Respect the victim/survivor's need for privacy. If the victim/survivor needs to be alone, respect that decision.<br>Do not suggest that the victim/survivor \"move on\" with their life and forget about the rape. The victim/survivor needs the opportunity to work through the trauma of the assault and begin the healing process.<br>Respect the victim/survivor's right to decide whether or not to report the assault to the police.<br>Remember to take care of yourself and seek support if you need it. You will be better able to support the victim/survivor."

Trafficking victims can be trafficked within their home country or internationally, whereas migrant smuggling always crosses national borders. Some trafficked people might start their journey by being smuggled into a country illegally, not knowing the intention of the trafficker to exploit them, or find themselves deceived, coerced or forced into an exploitative situation later in the process, for example being forced to work for no or very little money to pay for their transportation. Criminals may both traffic and smuggle people, employing the same routes and methods of transporting them."

                "Child marriage is a marriage or union in which one or both spouses are under 18 years old. Although this definition sounds straightforward, the realities of child marriage can be complicated. Both the words \"child\" and \"marriage\" are sometimes interpreted differently.<br><br>The internationally recognized definition of a child - established by the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), one of the most universally endorsed and widely ratified treaties in history - is \"every human being below the age of 18 years\". This is also the legal definition used in most parts of the world."

            "answer": [
                "It can be hard to imagine why someone would choose to have their child married off. But for millions of people, child marriage can seem like the best - or only - option.<br>Daughters are frequently seen as burdens or commodities because of pervasive gender inequality. Impoverished parents often believe marriage will secure a daughter's future by making a husband or his family responsible for her care. This may be the case when parents face economic hardships or when girls are forced by poverty or circumstance to drop out of school. In places where the bride's family pays a dowry to the groom's family, younger brides typically command smaller dowries, creating an incentive for parents to marry their daughters off early. In places where the groom's family pays a bride price, parents in difficult circumstances may marry off their daughters as a source of income.<br>Parents - especially in humanitarian crises - often view marriage as a way to protect their daughters from sexual violence. Child marriage rates have been known to increase during the chaos of war, as families endure both economic instability and fear of violence. Yet child marriage itself leads to girls experiencing high levels of sexual, physical and emotional violence from their intimate partners.<br>Although most adolescent pregnancies in the developing world take place among girls who are already married, in some places, teenage pregnancy - or even the possibility of teenage pregnancy - prompts parents to marry off their daughters. This is seen in both wealthy and poor countries where communities consider pregnancy outside of marriage to be shameful. Girls may even be forced to marry rapists to spare their families the stigma associated with unmarried pregnancy.and not all child marriages are the result of parents' or guardians' decisions. Often, adolescents themselves decide to marry or enter an informal union living with their partner, whether a peer or an older individual. These marriages may be a way to exercise independence, leave home or escape difficult circumstances, including desperate poverty or family violence. Restrictions on adolescent sexuality outside of marriage also drive some adolescents to see marriage as the only way to be sexually active.<br>In most cases, child marriage is the result of girls and families having few choices. Overwhelmingly, when young people have a choice, they marry later."

                "Child marriage is actually very common.<br>More than 650 million women and girls alive today were married before their 18th birthday. Nineteen per cent of women between the ages of 20 and 24 around the world were child brides. And while child marriage is most prevalent in low- and middle-income countries, it also takes place in high-income countries.<br>There is good news: global child marriage rates are slowly falling. Around 2000, one in three women between the ages of 20 and 24 reported they had been married as children. In 2021, this number was just under one in five. Rates of child marriage before age 15 also fell, from 11 per cent in 2000 to 5 per cent in 2021.<br>Still, progress has been uneven and child marriage is not declining fast enough. Because of population growth in regions where child marriage is more prevalent such as West and Central Africa, the rate of decline is slow and the total number of child marriages is projected to increase by 2030. COVID-19 has also set back efforts and exacerbated pressures on families thus leading to projected increases in child marriage. To change this, we must accelerate our actions to end the practice. "

The most common ages at which children are married are 16 and 17.<br>Marriages that take place before age 15 are considered \"very early marriages.\" These marriages have a particularly negative impact on girls, interrupting their education earlier and jeopardizing their health more acutely. Research by UNFPA shows that child marriage rates increase gradually until age 14 and accelerate significantly thereafter at ages 15 through 17. The majority of child marriage thus occurs in middle adolescence. <br>In circumstances where parents are under enormous pressure to marry off their daughters - for those living in extreme poverty or in conflict settings, for instance - marriages have been reported among girls around 11 or 12 because girls are seen both as being ready for marriage and at risk of sexual violence.<br>In some cases, children are as young as five when they are married, although this is rare. Extremely young brides and grooms are sometimes married in ceremony only but live with their parents until they reach adolescence."

This information is used as one of a variety of factors to evaluate the well-being of girls in a community.<br>Still, child marriages are not always unions between girls and much-older men. In some communities, it is customary to wed girls and boys of similar ages. And there are also cases of adolescents marrying one another voluntarily - sometimes called \"love marriages\" - and entering cohabiting unions forbidden by family members. Such marriages can put young people at risk of retributive violence, and because the spouses often run away, they may lack economic support or face social isolation. "

            ],
            "answer": [
                "Child marriage undermines children's human rights and derails their lives and future opportunities.<br><br>At the most basic level, it denies children the right to choose - with full and free consent and without coercion or fear - whom to marry and when. This is one of life's most important decisions.<br><br>And there are additional consequences. Child brides are more likely to become pregnant before their bodies are mature, increasing the risks of both maternal and newborn death and morbidity. In developing countries, the majority of births to adolescent girls occur within a marriage or a union. In these countries, where access to sexual and reproductive health services is generally low, complications from pregnancy and childbirth can be deadly. In fact, globally, these complications are the leading cause of death among adolescent girls.<br><br>Children who are married off are also vulnerable to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. Contributing to this problem is the fact that girls who have dropped out of school are more vulnerable to child marriage and less likely to be equipped with information about protecting themselves from STIs and unplanned pregnancy.<br><br>Child brides are particularly vulnerable to violence and abuse. Young women married as children were 1.5 times more likely to experience physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence than young women married as adults. They are less able to advocate for themselves and less able to escape abusive relationships. Mental illness is common among child brides, for example, due to their experience of violence. Girls who marry young are also more likely to think that wife beating is justified than women who marry later in life. <br><br>Married girls rarely enrol in school because they are expected to assume significant domestic responsibilities. This limits their future potential and makes it harder for their families to escape poverty.<br><br>Lack of education and empowerment also mean girls are less able to advocate for the well-being of their own children. The children of child brides have higher mortality rates, worse nutritional outcomes and tend to be less educated.<br><br>Girls in informal unions living with their partners experience many of the same consequences.<br><br>Cumulatively, child marriage takes an enormous toll on communities, workforces and economies, and the loss is carried over generations."

                "Laws prohibiting child marriage need to be enacted, strengthened and enforced. And more attention is needed to related laws such as on bride price and dowry, marital rape, birth and marriage registration and mandatory schooling.<br><br>But laws alone will not end child marriage.<br><br>Fundamentally, gender equality must be advanced. When educating daughters is considered as worthwhile as educating sons, when communities - both men and women - give equal weight to the future potential of girls and boys, there is less motivation to engage in child marriage.<br><br>Adolescent girls and boys are less likely to want to marry before age 18 when they are empowered with information about their sexual and reproductive health and when they are able to decide freely and responsibly matters related to their sexuality, free of coercion, discrimination and violence.<br><br>Improved circumstances for families can also reduce the incentive to marry off children. Families, including girls, need to be able to live in peace and move in safety. And poverty and economic inequality, which drive so many child marriages, must be eradicated. For this, many changes are needed, including social safety nets for girls and their families, as well as improved access to quality education, health services and economic opportunities.<br><br>Girls can play an important role in ending child marriage - when they know their rights and have access to the right information and opportunities. UNFPA has seen that when girls are empowered to claim their rights, they can persuade their families to delay or cancel engagements. Instead, they can stay in school, gain skills and support their families economically. Many have been inspired to become advocates and leaders in their communities.<br><br>UNFPA and its partners work to bring these changes to the most vulnerable girls. The UNFPA-UNICEF Global Programme to Accelerate Action to End Child Marriage is reaching girls in 12 countries in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, and mobilizing a movement against child marriage globally. The programme takes a gender-transformative approach to empowering girls with life skills and comprehensive sexuality education, increasing girls' access to education and health-care services and educating parents and communities on the consequences of child marriage, thus transforming harmful gender norms and stereotypes at the community levels. It is also contributing to a more girl-friendly legal and policy environment, and generating data on what works to address child marriage and related issues such as adolescent pregnancy, gender-based violence and HIV."

                "In the developing world, a majority of adolescent births (those among girls between the agee of 15 and 19) take place among girls who are already married or in union. This means that child marriage is often a precursor to early pregnancy, which poses a host of health risks to girls whose bodies may not yet be mature enough for motherhood. Globally, complications from pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death among adolescent girls.<br>In some places, the causality is reversed. While most adolescent childbearing occurs within marriage, it is not uncommon for first births that occur within marriage to be the result of premarital conceptions. The median proportion of adolescent girls whose pregnancy preceded marriage but resulted in a birth within marriage is 18 per cent; this phenomenon is more common in Africa than in other regions. Teenage pregnancy is often an incentive for parents to marry their daughters off. This is seen in countries all over the world where communities see pregnancy outside marriage as shameful. Girls may even be forced to marry rapists to spare their families the stigma associated with unmarried pregnancy.<br>Globally, child marriage and adolescent pregnancy are two major life events that have a significant and disproportionate negative impact on adolescent girls. One in five girls globally is married as a child, and a third of women begin childbearing in adolescence. "

                "If a player 'handles the ball deliberately' the opposing team gets a free kick or a penalty (if the offense happened inside the penalty box). The rule does not apply to a goalkeeper* handling it inside his own area. There are extra directives reminding referees about this rule infringement. It does not always mean a caution card or dismissal for a player deliberately handling the ball. The tricky part of determining the intention rests 'squarely' on the referee's shoulders. atch referees often consult their assistants on FIFA handball rule decisions. A top class soccer referee described his interpretation of the rules. He said the decision results from whether the player's hand or arm contacts the ball in an 'unnatural' position. They said they would try to ascertain if the hand moved 'unnaturally' towards the ball. Or, was it an unintentional block. So, was the path blocked because the upper limb was where it would 'naturally' be for that interception.The official's decision becomes even more challenging if the player extends or fans out upper limbs. Attempting to become a bigger block for the shot happens often.As a rule, raising your arms to protect yourself from a speeding ball is not classed as intentional handball. Making that instant distinction is a crucial part of good soccer refereeing. It does not matter how many years of experience you have in FIFA football rules as a Premiership or International referee. There is likely to be one team - and thousands of devoted supporters - who disagree with the decision."

                "As a rule, a direct free kick results from a contact foul or a handling misconduct. Most of the other football rules' infringements result in indirect free kicks. In soccer, a football penalty kick gets awarded if an outfield player from the defending team handles it within their own goal area. Referees use direct and indirect kicks to restart play following an infraction. When play gets restarted, the ball must be stationary before a player kicks it. The opposing players should be at least 10 yards away from the ball.Following football referee rules, the ref will hold one arm straight up in the air for an indirect free kick. Their arm remains upright until the ball gets passed to a second player. DIRECT FREE KICK : You can score by kicking the ball 'directly' into the goal. INDIRECT FREE KICK : You cannot score 'directly' from the first kick. So, an indirect free kick must make contact with another player before it can pass over the goal line."

                "Law 12 in the FIFA Official Rules Book PDF explains the regulations and procedures. It provides the definition and the punishment for a deliberate handball in football. Here's an extract of that regulation: Players would get sent off for denying a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity. A direct free kick is awarded if a player commits any of the following offences:Handles the ball deliberately (except for the goalkeeper within their penalty area). Throws an object at the ball, at an opponent, or at a match official. Makes contact with the ball using a held object (e.g. a boot, clothing, or a shin guard). There is one simple explanation of the handball foul in football. Did the player's hand or arm, from the tips of the fingers to the shoulder, play the ball? And if so, was it done with intent? A ball which is first kicked, and then hits a player's hand or arm, is rarely ruled as ball handling. The referee must use good judgment to decide whether the handball ball was accidental contact. Football hand ball rule governs any purposeful attempt to gain advantage such as: Ball to Hand: Legal in soccer football rules and regulations. Hand to Ball: Illegal and penalized in football handball rules. Goalkeeper Back-pass: Ball Handling by Goalkeepers - There is a situation in football which does not allow the goalkeeper to use their hands. Of course, we are referring to the 'back-pass rule'. Goalkeepers must not handle a pass, with either of their hands, if it came directly from one of their teammates. Instead, the goalie must use their feet to pass the ball to one of their players, or boot it forwards. An indirect kick from the point of the infraction will occur if the keeper breaches the soccer back-pass rule."

It may not sound like a game changer - but it usually is! We are talking about 20 Premier League football teams here. Questionable soccer handball rules stir enraged passion and anger like no other regulation in the game.The reaction gets worse: Players, managers, and raucous soccer fans rarely dispute FIFA football handball rules in a quiet manner. A dodgy penalty decision never results in a calm and noiseless reaction from the stands. When it happens, the match referee must make an instant decision about the offence. First of all, the official has to decide whether in fact the ball hit the footballer's hand, arm or shoulder. What happens if the referee determines that it did? They will question whether it happened because the player was in the path as the ball got played. Or, did the defender spread his arms intentionally to block the shot or the pass."

This rule excludes a goalkeeper while they are handling the ball inside their own penalty area. Note: If a player gets sent off they must leave the vicinity of the pitch - without delay.

But, they cannot handle it with either of their hands, arms, or any moving parts of their shoulder (if outside their own penalty area).Doing so, would be breaching the football handball rules. The foul is most likely to get punished by a direct free kick. It's awarded to the opponents and taken from the location of the infringement.

Furthermore, it was a style of play that failed to receive any kind of sanction. But here's the kicker : It was a footballing era when keepers would take as many steps as they liked. They could do so - providing they bounced the ball on the ground as they moved (or threw it in the air and caught again). But, the rule-makers hit back! They declared that if a keeper held the ball with his hands, and then placed it on the ground, the ball must make contact with another player before they could touch it again with their hands. Goalkeepers responded. They started holding the ball and then throwing it to a nearest defender. The defenders would return it, and then repeat the whole process over again.

They did it as part of the rules of fair play. FIFA made clear rulings for any player negating the spirit of the new soccer pass back rule - with intent. Players would get cautioned. This show of unsporting behaviour would also get punished by an indirect free-kick. There were many long debates. They decided to extend the successful football pass back rule. They also applied it to throw-ins from defenders to their own goalkeeper. Even so, the urge to extend it to all back-passes (with the head, thigh, chest, etc.) got resisted. The International Football Association Board and FIFA both agreed. They always insisted they have no deliberate conspiracy against footballers or goalkeepers. But, their aim is to keep the game of association football as fluid and as skillful as they can.

Players can use a chest pass, a knee, or a header of the ball, back to the goalkeeper if the objective is to stop an attacking move by the opposition. As a rule, this move would not be a deliberate back pass rule violation. Nonetheless, the referee must see them as unintentional back-passes to avoid awarding a free kick.

If that's not working, place a wooden spoon across the top to break up the bubbles. Try not to add olive oil to the pasta while it's boiling.

However, some of these nutrients and fertilizers can affect the micro-organisms in the soil's ability to produce natural compounds the crops need. <br>2. Soil Loss. While soil loss has improved greatly since the 1980s, farming still leads to loss of soil, due to processes like clearing trees and plowing. These losses are roughly 5 tons of soil for each ton of grain planted.  <br>3. Overgrazing. The last way farming impacts soil is through overgrazing, which is when animals eat large amounts of the natural vegetation, causing the soil to wash or blow away. Extreme overgrazing can even lead to desertification or expansion of desert conditions, once the natural plant cover has been eliminated. "

Arable Farming. With arable farming, the farmer plants only crops like vegetables, grains, or legumes. If you are a \u201cdo it yourself\u201d (DIY) at-home farmer, chances are you practice arable farming. <br>2. Mixed Farming. Mixed farming mixes the planting of crops with the raising of animals on the same piece of land. Most traditional farms practice mixed farming.  <br>3. Subsistence Farming. Subsistence farming is done to provide food for the farmer and his family. Subsistence farming is generally DIY and produces low yields.  <br>4. Shifting Cultivation. One of the most controversial farming systems, shifting cultivation occurs when a farmer clears a piece of land, uses it for 3-5 years, then abandons it when it has been used up. Many governments discourage this type of farming as it is not very sustainable. <br>5. Plantation Farming. One of the oldest farming systems. Plantation farming uses a large piece of land to grow one specific crop, like cotton or tea. Plantation farming is also sometimes referred to as tree crop farming.  <br>6. Livestock Farming. Similar to arable farming, livestock farming focuses solely on raising animals, not planting crops. This is another farming system that is not very sustainable because the animals' grazing eventually destroys the land.  <br>7. Nomadic Farming. Similar to livestock farming. In nomadic farming, the farmer moves his or her animals around in search of fresh grazing and water. "

Nutrients have a direct impact on things like protein production, photosynthesis, and root, shoot, and leaf development. <br>2. Water Availability. The amount of water your crops receive plays a direct role in the amount of crops you produce. Too little water and your crops will shrivel up and die. Too much water and you end up with wasted water, energy, and labor. <br>3. Climate. The climate your crops are planted in heavily influences crop production. Factors such as humidity, temperature, and wind can wreak havoc on your crops. One of the major benefits of farming in a controlled environment, like a shipping container or greenhouse, is it allows you to control the climate 24/7.  <br>4. Pests and diseases. Pests and diseases damage your crops directly by eating or destroying the plants themselves. But pests also destroy your crops in less obvious ways like damaging plant roots, altering the ability of the plant to absorb nutrients.  "

                "There are five major ways technology has affected farming: <br>1. Livestock genetics and breeding. Humans have been attempting to breed healthier, more productive animals for more than 10,000 years. Breakthroughs in technology, like artificial insemination and gene editing, have allowed humans to improve livestock genetics.<br>2. Crop genetics. Just like humans have been experimenting with breeding superior animals for thousands of years, so too have humans attempted to breed more robust resilient plants. Technological advances, like marker assisted breeding, have allowed farmers to increase crop yields across the world. <br>3. Labor and automation. When you think about how farming has been affected by technology, you probably think about machinery. From the cotton gin to the tractor, improvements in farming technology have led directly to more food being produced with less labor. <br>4. Livestock facilities. Just a few decades ago, farmers had to keep all of their livestock outside, at the mercy of the elements, thieves, and natural predators. But over the past few years, there has been a dramatic rise in the use of climate-controlled barns. These barns have WI-FI, automatic feed systems, and more. Farmers can monitor these smart barns from their cellphones and even make adjustments to the conditions the livestock is in. All without having to set foot in the barn. <br>5. Specialization. Finally, more advanced technology has brought a specialized approach to farming. Gone are the days of growing everything on the same farm, instead today's farmers use specific technology to perfect a few types of crops. You will also see farms honing in on specific niches, like Pure Greens does with container farming or Queen Creek Olive Mill does with olives. "

By applying good agricultural practices can reduce the risk of harmful contamination of your produce. Best agricultural practices for reducing microbial contamination ensure that the food that you sell to the public will not cause harm or illness to consumers. Some of the important agricultural practices are:<br>1. Soil preparation Soil preparation is important for plant growth. Before planting a crop, the soil is to be prepared by ploughing, levelling, and manuring. Sowing-Selection of good quality seeds is the primary stage of sowing. Sowing is the procedure by which seeds are buried inside the soil. After the sowing process, the seeds germinate inside the soil and then grow up to become a complete plant. Germination is also called the sprouting of seeds.<br>2. Manuring - In farming, manure is organic matter that is used as organic fertilizer. Manure mainly consists of animal feces and other sources include compost and green manure. It is organic matter used as fertilizer in agriculture. Manures improve soil fertility by adding lots of nutrients like nitrogen that is trapped by bacteria in the soil.<br>3. Irrigation - It is the supply of water to land or crops to help grow and increase crop yield.<br>4. Weeding- Weeding mainly refers to the removal of weeds. Weed control is done in an early crop stage, as this is more practical (the weed plants are smaller) and more effective.<br>5. Harvesting - The harvesting is done properly to maximize crop yield and minimize any crop losses. The harvesting process can be done manually, using hands or knife and it can be done mechanically with the use of rippers, combine harvesters, or other machines. <br>6.Storage - It is defined as the method of storing something for future use."

Some examples of fixed costs are capital costs of buying farm machineries like a tractor, permanent labor (salaries), and land rent. Froma management perspective, high fixed costs usually put pressure on the profitability of a farm and must be managed carefully. A reductlon in fixed costs, without affecting production can increase profits."

The farmer and his family grow grains for themselves or sale at the local market.<br>* Intensive agriculture - This practice can be seen in densely populated areas in lndia. This method is an attempt to maximize the output of the land, through the use of every possible effort. It needs a huge amount of capital in addition to a great deal of human labor, but more than one crop can be raised per year.<br>* Extensive agriculture This is the modern farming type that can be seen largely in the developed world and some parts of India. It relies largely on machinery as opposed to a human labor force and also raises one crop per year.<br>* Commercial agriculture - The goal of commercial agriculture farming is a high yield so that products can be exported to other countries or areas for profit. Wheat, cotton, sugarcane, and corn are some of the important commercial crops and they are grown in states including Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana, and Maharashtra.<br>* Plantation agriculture - This farming is used for crops that require a lot of space and a long growing period like rubber, tea, coconut, coffee, cocoa, spices, and fruits.<br>* Dryland farming- Dryland farming is done in the arid and desert-like areas of the country.Some crops like jowar, bajra, and peas can be grown in these conditions. <br>* Wetland farming - Wetland farming is suitable for farming rice, jute, and sugarcane."

The instrument, created in 1701 by the English farmer Jethro Tull, allowed farmers to sow seeds in well-spaced rows at specific depths at a specific rate. Before this, farmers cast seeds to the ground in a haphazard fashion by hand, allowing them to grow where they landed (called \u201cbroadcasting\u201d). The seed drill allowed farmers more control over their crops and less waste, and it was one of Tull's several inventions, which included the horse-drawn hoe and an improved plough. Seed drills are still in use today, although they are much more sophisticated mechanisms."

                "Yes. In 1997 a team of scientists at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, Scotland, announced the birth of Dolly the sheep, the first clone (identical copy) of an adult mammal. The process used to create Dolly, called somatic cell nuclear transfer, began with an egg cell from one sheep. The scientists destroyed that egg cell's nucleus and then injected the nucleus from the cell of another sheep into the egg cell. With a little encouragement from electronic stimulation, the donated nucleus fused with the egg cell, and the new cell began to divide. The cluster of cells was then implanted into the uterus of the sheep that had provided the egg cell, and five months later Dolly was born\u2014an exact replica not of the sheep that had carried her in the womb but of the sheep that had supplied the nucleus. While cloning mammals is controversial, some scientists argue that cloning farm animals has advantages to livestock farmers, who could use the technology to breed only high-quality animals that produce the most milk or the finest wool."
